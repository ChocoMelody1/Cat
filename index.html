<h1>Voldryne</h1>

<p>Voldryne

Voldryne is the biggest of the islands that make up Agoria.
 
 Voldryne is known for not having the best hospitality toward non-human visitors, especially their Quiora neighbors. 

 Voldryne’s capital, Encrid, has multiple ruling leaders. The main of these leaders is King Cosarde Antiga, ruler of the Varildryes Empire.

<P> The Oriana Coast

The Oriana Coast sits on the east coast of Voldryne, and is the biggest trading center in Agoria. The capital of the Oriana Coast is Kinnvar, the city of Knowledge. 
 
 The Oriana Coast’s representative is the Auroral Federation, the government that takes care of the political side of The Oriana Coast’s associations.

<p>Sarcross

Sarcross sits north east of the Oriana Coast out to sea. It is ruled by the Blood Captain Cyning Mintz. 
 
 Sarcross is known for being a pirate haven away from the strict rules of Voldryne.
